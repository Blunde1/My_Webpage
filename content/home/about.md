# Biography

I am a senior consultant for [Sonat](https://sonat.no/people/berent-lunde) at [Equinor](https://www.equinor.com/), an Adjunct Associate Professor in Statistics at [The University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/persons/Berent.%C3%85nund.Str%C3%B8mnes.Lunde) and a licensed actuary.

#### Research 🔭 \
My research interests include computational statistics, information theory, financial and actuarial mathematics, machine learning, and programming, while applications to problems with latent dynamics are especially interesting.

- See my [UiB homepage](https://www.uib.no/en/persons/Berent.%C3%85nund.Str%C3%B8mnes.Lunde) for more details  on everything research related.

#### Software 📱 \
Most of my software is open source on [Github](https://github.com/Blunde1) and tied to my research such as 

- [aGTBoost](https://github.com/Blunde1/agtboost): Adaptive and automatic gradient boosting computations
- [GraphSPME](https://github.com/equinor/GraphSPME): High dimensional precision matrix estimation with a known graphical structure
- [ensemble-information-filter](https://github.com/equinor/MIG-data-assimilation): High dimensional data assimilation on Gaussian Markov Random Fieds

but there are exceptions:

- [atomic-bouldering-progression](https://play.google.com/store/apps): App for optimizing and logging training for climbing

#### Hobbies 🧗🏻🐕‍🦺🛶🏕️ \
I seek to go on more adventures into the wild. Preferably together with my wife and our Eurasier dog dog Arya (chalk-bearer).
I also enjoy climbing both indoors and outdoors while hammocking and in good company, and perhaps enjoy an easy kayak trip.

#### Blogging 💻 \
When I have time and energy to spare, about things I find interesting.

#### Fandom 🙏🏻 \
I am a huge fan of 
[TMB](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp), 
[XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) and 
[Rcpp](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp).
