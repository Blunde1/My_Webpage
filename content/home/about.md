# Biography

I currently reside in [Equinor](https://www.equinor.com/) as a principal scientific developer.

#### Research 🔭 \
I work with computational statistics on a practical and theoretical level. Generally researching information theoretic approaches to make ML-algorithms adaptive to the problem/data at hand. I currently target large scale ensemble based data assimilation.


#### Software 📱 \
Most of my software is open source on [Github](https://github.com/Blunde1) and tied to my research such as 

- [aGTBoost](https://github.com/Blunde1/agtboost): Adaptive and automatic gradient boosting computations
- [graphite-maps](https://github.com/equinor/graphite-maps): High dimensional data assimilation on Gaussian Markov Random Fieds

#### Hobbies 🧗🏻🐕‍🦺🛶🏕️ \
I like adventures in nature. Preferably together with my wife and our eurasier dog Arya (chalk-bearer).
I also enjoy climbing both indoors and outdoors while hammocking and in good company, and perhaps enjoy an easy kayak trip.

#### Blogging 💻 \
When I have time and energy to spare, about things I find interesting.

#### Fandom 🙏🏻 \
I am a huge fan of 
[TMB](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp), 
[XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) and 
[Rcpp](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp).
