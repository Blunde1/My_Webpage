# Biography

I am a PhD candidate in statistics at the [University of Stavanger](https://www.uis.no/?lang=en_GB).
My research interests include computational statistics, information theory, financial and actuarial mathematics, machine learning, and programming, while applications to problems with latent dynamics are especially interesting.

Current work is in the intersect of probability theory, information and boosting algorithms; exploring and developing fully automated gradient tree boosting. 
Other work include numerical Maximum Likelihood optimisation using saddlepoint methods with applications to stochastic differential equations with jumps.

I enjoy seeing the applications of ideas to practice, and as such I actively participate in 
[ML competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/berent), 
have led a seminar-series with the intent of understanding
"start-of-the-art" methods and methodology, and apply these for practical purposes in competitions.
Recently I also won a [hackathon](https://github.com/Blunde1/AquaLens) using data science methodology

I am a certified actuary and a fortunate winner of
[Aktuarprisen](http://aktfor.no/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Likelihood-Estimation-of-Jump-Diffusions-Berent.pdf)
2017 awarded by the Norwegian Society of Actuaries, and I have worked as an actuary in a major nordic non-life insurance company.

I am a huge fan of 
[TMB](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp), 
[XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) and 
[Rcpp](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp).
